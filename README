Run the following commands to get set up:

OPTIONAL ----------------------
You can download these libraries in a virtual enviornment, so the libraries are not installed globally: 
$ virtualenv [whatever-name-you-choose]
$ cd [whatever-name-you-choose]
$ source bin/activate

Ensure the ChromeDriver and geckdoriver in this directory are compatible with your version of Chrome.

Run the required libraries.
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program:
$ python TestAgeDeduction.py


DEBUGGING ---------------------
If you get a WebDriverException with the ChromeDriver, download the driver of the Chrome version you have already, from here: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html, and place it into this directory.
